#Circuit Crawler Editor

An editor for [Circuit Crawler](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lds.game&hl=en).

While Circuit Crawler itself doesn't have any sort of custom level support (or
even the latest version on the Play Store), this project should be a nice
example point for anyone looking to make a level editor in C# using Windows
Forms and OpenTK.

I'm not expecting anyone to use this, so the bugs that are present will remain
there unless anyone cares enough to fix them and send a pull request. For this
same reason, I'm not going to go over how to use the editor or the controls or
anything like that. This project should be structured well enough that finding
this information in the source code should only take a few minutes.

This project is released under the MIT license.
